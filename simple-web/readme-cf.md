# To use this CloudFormation template:

Replace **"YourBucketName"** with your desired bucket name.
Save the template to a **.yaml** or **.json** file (e.g., simple-web.yaml).
Deploy the CloudFormation stack using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
After deploying the stack, you'll receive the URL of the S3 bucket website endpoint where your static website will be hosted. 
If you've opted for CloudFront, you'll also receive the CloudFront distribution URL for content delivery.
