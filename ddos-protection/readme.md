To protect an AWS static web host from DDoS attacks using Terraform, you can use AWS Shield and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF). 

Hereâ€™s a sample Terraform configuration that applies AWS Shield and AWS WAF to a CloudFront distribution, which is often used to host static websites securely.

## Notes:

WAF Configuration: This script sets up AWS WAF with a common rule set to help protect against common threats.

CloudFront Distribution: A CloudFront distribution is created for the static website hosted on S3.

AWS Shield Protection: This example provides basic protection using AWS Shield for CloudFront.

Ensure Compliance: Ensure that this configuration meets your organization's compliance and security standards.


## Additional Considerations:

AWS Shield Advanced: To use Shield Advanced, ensure that the service is enabled and subscription charges apply.

Custom WAF Rules: Depending on your website, consider adding custom WAF rules to address specific security needs.
