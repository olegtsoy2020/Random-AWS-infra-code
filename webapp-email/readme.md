To set up static web hosting using AWS and Terraform with Simple Email Service (SES) integration, you'll first need a Terraform script that configures the necessary AWS resources. 
Below is a simple example of how you can do this. This script will:


Create an S3 bucket for static web hosting.

Configure an SES domain identity for sending emails.

Set up the necessary policies and permissions.


## Step 1: Initialize Terraform

First, you need to initialize your project with a webapp-email.tf file

## Step 2: Prepare the Email and Website Files

For the website, you need an index.html and error.html file placed in your S3 bucket. 
For the email, ensure your DNS settings include the required TXT and MX records to verify your SES domain and enable email sending.

## Step 3: Run Terraform

After setting up your Terraform configuration:

**Initialize Terraform**: Run terraform init to initialize the working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

**Plan Deployment**: Run terraform plan to see the execution plan and make sure everything looks correct.

**Apply Configuration**: Run terraform apply to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

## Step 4: Upload Website Content

You can use the AWS CLI to upload your website content via AWS CLI

`aws s3 cp ./path_to_your_website_files s3://my-unique-bucket-name/ --recursive`

## Step 5: Verify SES Domain and Set Up Email Sending

Verify your domain with SES and configure DNS properly to handle the verification records and email sending.

That's a basic example to get you started with static website hosting and email services using Terraform on AWS. 
Adjust the script according to your specific requirements and ensure you manage your state files securely, especially in team environments.
